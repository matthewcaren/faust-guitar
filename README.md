# Faust DSP Guitar

A custom-designed guitar that uses Faust running on the Teensy to provide low-latency stereo DSP built into the guitar itself.

The effects chain features a variable-ratio compressor, phaser (modeled after the MXR Phase 90), an original "division" gated fuzz algorithm, and custom modulated FDN reverb. Includes compiled DSP files for the Teensy 3.6, FAUST source files, and enclosure designs for laser-cutting/3D printing.
